            "content": "I used to love Hill Climb Racing 2, but the constant ads have made it frustrating. There’s an ad after every race, which disrupts the flow and takes away from the fun. I’d be willing to pay a one-time fee to remove ads permanently, but it feels like the game is pushing for a monthly subscription just to enjoy it. I understand the need for ads, but having them after every race is excessive and really undermines the gameplay. Until there’s a better solution, I can’t recommend this game.",

In my opinion game shouldn't be irritating and frustrating. It should be relaxing like you are getting your reward for your hard work. I've seen many people complaining about this game in YT, but I think this game not that much bad than what the YT-bers says. So I gave this game a solid 4.9/5.",
